###################################  Script Purpose ############################################
# Uses milestones.csv, features.csv, and userstories.csv to process data for Tableau vizualization.
# In all cases the views are filtered by PSI Release prior to exporing to a csv file.
#
# milestones.csv is extarcted from Rally's Plan -> Timeboxes
# The default view was ammended to incluse Notes in addition to the out-of-the box fields.
# Since there is no separate field to indicate milestone status, a status section was added 
# within the NOtes field. It has the following format: Status: [status value]. 
# No Status entry indicates that the milestone is on track.
# Color is used to indicate the type of milestone: external dependency or DPIM deliverable.
#
# features.csv is extracted from Rally's Portfolio -> Portfolio Items
# The default view was ammeded to include the following additional columns:
# Milestones, Initiative, State, Tag. Tag is used to track feature status.
# 
# userstories.csv is extracted from Rally's Plan -> User Stories. 
# To get the appropriate data I created a custom view under Plan -> User Stories.
# The view is called "User Stories with Features" and in addition to the defaul fields 
# has the feature that a user story is associated with. Also added is a count of the number of children so we 
# can determine if a story is a parent story.
# All user stories that fall under a SAFe release are listed out even if they do not have features.
