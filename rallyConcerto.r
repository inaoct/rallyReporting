###################################  Script Purpose ############################################
# Uses milestones.csv, features.csv, initiatives.csv, and userstories.csv to process data for Tableau vizualization.
# In all cases the views are filtered by PSI Release prior to exporing to a csv file.
#
# milestones.csv is extarcted from Rally's Plan -> Timeboxes
# The default view was ammended to incluse Notes in addition to the out-of-the box fields.
# Since there is no separate field to indicate milestone status, a status section was added
# within the Notes field. It has the following format: Status: [status value].
# No Status entry indicates that the milestone is on track.
# Color is used to indicate the type of milestone: external dependency or DPIM deliverable.
#
# features.csv is extracted from Rally's Portfolio -> Portfolio Items (Features)
# The default view was ammeded to include the following additional columns:
# Milestones, Initiative, State, Tag. Tag is used to track feature status.
#
# initiatives.csv is extracted from Rally's Portfolio -> Portfolio Items (Initiatives)
# The default view was ammeded in the same way as for features but the info is not relevant.
#
# userstories.csv is extracted from Rally's Plan -> User Stories.
# To get the appropriate data I created a custom view under Plan -> User Stories.
# The view is called "User Stories with Features" and in addition to the default fields
# has the feature that a user story is associated with. Also added is a count of the number of children so we
# can determine if a story is a parent story.
# All user stories that fall under a SAFe release are listed out even if they do not have features.
#
# Instructions for correctly populating the necessary data files can be found in the following doc:
# https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oAAEczpufGGxhYO_9ElY5II2Tvn4JC_6kYEAPjgEO84/edit

## IMPORTANT!!! WHEN RUNNING FROM WORK with proxy
#  Make sure to run Sys.setenv(http_proxy= "http://proxy.inbcu.com/:8080")
#  Must be run FIRST - at start of session. Otherwise it does not take.

## IMPORTANT!!! Invoke script with the following command:
# system(paste("RScript rallyConcerto.R","username", "password"))
# where username and password represent the login info for Rally
# Note that when running from work - go to wireless NBCU_BYOD. Otherwise I get curl errors

## Handle library pre-requisites
# Using dplyr for its more intuitive data frame processing
if (!require(dplyr))
  install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
# Using lubridate for easier date manipulation
if (!require(lubridate))

# Using splitstackshape to split multiple values in a cell into separate rows
if (!require(splitstackshape))

# Using xlsx for saving results to excel
if (!require(xlsx))
